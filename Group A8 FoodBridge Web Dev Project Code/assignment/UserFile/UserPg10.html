    <h1>About Foodbridge</h1>
    <h3>About Us - Foodbridge

        Welcome to Foodbridge, a heartfelt initiative founded by Nicholas Khoo on April 25, 2022. At Foodbridge, we believe in the transformative power of food to bridge gaps, nourish communities, and create lasting positive change. Our journey began with a simple yet profound idea: to connect surplus food with those who need it the most, fostering a bridge of compassion and solidarity in the process.
        <br><br>
        Our Founder - Nicholas Khoo
        <br><br>
        Nicholas Khoo, the visionary behind Foodbridge, is a passionate advocate for social equality and a firm believer in the potential for collective action to make a difference. Recognizing the staggering levels of food waste juxtaposed with the persistent issue of hunger in our communities, Nicholas felt compelled to take action. Armed with his determination, compassion, and a dedicated team, he laid the foundation for Foodbridge.
        <br><br>
        Our Mission
        <br><br>
        At Foodbridge, our mission is to combat hunger and reduce food waste by building a strong bridge between surplus food and those experiencing food insecurity. We envision a world where no one goes to bed hungry, where the abundance of food resources is channeled to uplift lives, and where compassion is the driving force behind every meal served.
        <br><br>
        What We Do
        <br><br>
        Through strategic partnerships with local businesses, farms, restaurants, and food distributors, we rescue excess food that would otherwise go to waste. We ensure that this surplus food reaches the tables of individuals and families facing economic hardships. Our innovative approach not only addresses immediate hunger but also contributes to the reduction of food waste, minimizing the environmental impact of discarded food.
        <br><br>
        Our Values
        <br><br>
        Compassion: We believe in the power of empathy and kindness to inspire positive change and create stronger communities.
        <br><br>
        Collaboration: Our success is built on partnerships and collaboration with various stakeholders, including donors, volunteers, and community organizations.
        <br><br>
        Sustainability: We are committed to reducing food waste and minimizing our ecological footprint, contributing to a more sustainable future for all.
        <br><br>
        Dignity: Every individual has the right to access nutritious food with dignity, and we strive to uphold this principle in all our endeavors.
        <br><br>
